# Introduction to Data Science and Machine Learning

Teaching material for an introductory course on Data Science and Machine Learning. I am using this material for a fourth undergraduate course of Telecommunication Engineering at [University Carlos III in Madrid (Spain)](https://www.uc3m.es/Home).

I have structured the course with XX lessons organized as follows:

1. Introduction to Python Notebooks and Numpy
2. Introduction to Pandas 
3. Linear regression with a single variable
4. Learning curves, regularization, and cross validation
5. Numerical optimization with gradient descend
6. Nonparametric regression
7. Introduction to binary classification and logistic regression
8. The kernel trick in logistic regression
9. Support Vector Machines
10. Multiclass classificaiton
11. Unsupervised Learning. Clustering with K-means
12. Clustering with Gaussian Mixture Models and the EM algorithm
13. Dimensionality Reduction with PCA. Probabilistic PCA.
14. Latent-Dirichelet Allocation. Finding similar documents in a corpus of documents.
15. Introduction to Neural Networks & Tensorflow
16. Building an image classifier with Convolutional Neural Networks
17. Word Embeddings
18. Recurrent Neural Networks for text prediction

For every lesson, I provide a self-contained notebook with both models descriptions and theoretical description (using integrated LaTeX Markdown blocks) and practical examples. In sessions 3-5, all steps are implemented manually (so students can learn how to implement stuff by themselves) but from session 6 we start using built-in [sciki-learn libraries](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/).
